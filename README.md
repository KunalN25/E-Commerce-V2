# E-Commerce-V2
Electron is a dummy E-commerce website which only has basic cart functionality(for now). I have used React framework to create the website.
The first page i.e. the Home Page shows a list of products which are only defined temporarily. All of them have an add button which adds them to the cart. I have used
localStorage to implement the cart. So, when the products are added, they are saved in the local storage of the browser and then used in the cart component. In the cart 
component, the user can increase the product's count or remove the product. After that I have created a checkout page to confirm the order and calculate the total price. 
Then, there is a pay option(a dummy) after which the user sees a Payment successful message.
